# Introduction

Fusi Software Development Kit is a developer toolkit for Focus headband. Developers can use the SDK to develop applications that are suitable for multiple platforms. They can easily access the user's EEG raw data, brain wave data, user attention data, etc.

The SDK supports a wide range of platforms with high-performance AI algorithms implemented in low-level programming language, and provides some basic computations while implementing multiple EEG data monitoring functions.

We have designed our technology to enable new forthcoming algorithms to work with our existing Focus headband hardware. Begin your development and familiarity with our API today so that you can take full advantage of the next series of algorithms.

## Features

* Scan available Wi-Fi hotspots
* Configure headband Wi-Fi connection to specific Wi-Fi
* Automatic scanning to find the headband in a Wi-Fi network
* Query the amount of battery power in the headband
* Query the alpha spike frequency of the user's brain power (only when available)
* Monitor the connection status of the application with the headband
* Monitor the rotating posture of the application and the headband
* Monitor user EEG raw voltage data
* Monitor user EEG frequency band energy (Delta, Theta, Alpha, LowBeta, HighBeta, Gamma) 
* Monitor user's current attention rating (BrainCo private AI algorithm)
* Monitor user's blink events

## Core function

* **Monitor user EEG raw voltage data**

	When the user wears the headband and the headband is well connected, the developer will get the EEG data(`EEGData` object) every half second, including the sampling rate and an array of raw EEG data.

	Focus headband has the precision equivalent to medical-standard EEG equipment, and its signal has a strong correlation(97.5%) with Gtek EEG equipment. Developers can collect raw data for scientific research and customized analysis.

* **Monitor user EEG frequency band energy (Delta, Theta, Alpha, LowBeta, HighBeta, Gamma)**

	The developer gets a summary of the frequency domain energy distribution every half second, including the Delta, Theta, Alpha, Low-Beta, High-Beta and Gamma bands.
		
	Developers can use data to make applications related to the EEG frequency domain, such as neurofeedback training applications. 
	
* **Monitor user's current attention rating (BrainCo private AI algorithm)**

	The developer gets an estimated value of the user's current attention every half second, and the APP related to the force, for example, when learning A warning box pops up when the attention is low.
